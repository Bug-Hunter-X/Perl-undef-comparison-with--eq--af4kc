This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating a subtle bug related to comparing undefined values using the 'eq' operator. The bug.pl file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.pl provides the corrected version.  The issue arises because 'undef' in Perl behaves differently in string contexts than you might initially expect.  This example illustrates a common pitfall that can lead to unexpected behavior in Perl programs.
